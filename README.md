# ambient_slideshow_linux

Ambient slideshow for Linux based on FEH, with images from Pexels. You need to provide your API key, and you can start it by specifying a tag to search for:

```
$ ambient_slideshow tag
```

For example, you can specify 'nature' as tag. It will download 30 images. For the first bucket of images, you'll need to wait for it to download them, then it will be (hopefully) smooth. Add it to your path and create your ambient! You can toggle the fullscreen mode on FEH using 'f' on Debian/Redhat or using 'v' on Ubuntu.
